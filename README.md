Funky bash scripts ayo

## 📂 Nautilus scripts/ ##
Right-click actions. To install, put them in ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts

I don't know for other file managers.


### 📄 pin ###
Transform any file or folder into a pseudo "app", so it appears in the app grid or launcher, and can be put into a dock (the latter of which I was striving for)
- Detects automagically the right icon to use
- includes actions: remove the "app", edit it, open the location of the file or folder
- Theoretically desktop agnostic

### 📄 fix-deepin-icon-theme.sh (not up yet) ###
Require: deepin-icon-theme installed.
Create a local icon theme, which inherits from deepin-icon-theme, but:
- Which also fixes non-standard stuff in the original theme (like broken download icon).
- Have icons made for Deepin DE be applied to GNOME apps.
- Have deepin icons be applied a bit more broadly outside of their DE.
