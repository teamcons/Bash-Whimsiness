Funky bash scripts ayo

## Nautilus scripts/
**pin**
- put it in /.local/share/nautilus/scripts
- now from a right click you can transform any file or folder as menu entry
- and pin it on your dock as if it were an app :)
- include actions: delete the entry, edit it, open the locasion of the file or folder
- Theoretically desktop agnostic

- I used that while DMing, for secret intuition/perception PC throws, environmental stuff, NPCs...
